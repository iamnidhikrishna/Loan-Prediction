# Loan Approval Prediction using Support Vector Machine

## Project Description
This classification project predicts whether a bank loan application will be approved based on applicant information such as gender, marital status, income, credit history, and more. The goal is to demonstrate how machine learning models can assist in risk assessment and decision-making in financial services.

## Model Used
Support Vector Machine (SVM - Linear Kernel)

## Dataset
Loan dataset (manually cleaned version of public bank loan data)

## Performance
- Training Accuracy: ~79.2%
- Testing Accuracy: ~85.4%

## Files
- `loan-approval-predictor.ipynb` – Full notebook with preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and predictions
- `data/loan.csv` – Dataset used for training (if shared publicly)

## How to Run
